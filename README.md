<h1> Creating a Speech to Text Converter Website</h1> 

This is the documentation on how I create a basic tool that can convert speech to text. The basic feature of the website are below :

<ul>
  <li>The user is able to turn the tool on or off </li>
  <li> The user is able to have 2 options to select from : convert while you speak and convert after you speak</li>
  <li> The user is able to save the speech that they have created into a permanent box </li>
</ul>

 The picture below shows the final website that was created.
